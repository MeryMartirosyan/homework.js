/* Ex.1 ==>> Write a function that accepts a string(a sentence) as a parameter and finds the longest
word within the stringâ€¤ If there are several words which are the longest ones, print the
last word (words can be separated by space). */ 



/* Ex.2 ==>> Write a function to find longest substring in a given a string without repeating characters
except space character.
If there are several, return the last one. Consider that all letters are lowercase. */



/* Ex.3 ==>> Write a function to compute a new string from the given one by moving the first char to
come after the next two chars, so &quot;abc&quot; yields &quot;bca&quot;. Repeat this process for each
subsequent group of 3 chars. Ignore any group of fewer than 3 chars at the end. */
